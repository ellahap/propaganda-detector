# Propaganda Detector

## About
This project was created for UIUC's [LING 413: Corpus Linguistics](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2025/spring/LING/413).  It is a propaganda detector built upon data collected for the [2019 Workshop on NLP4IF](http://www.netcopia.net/nlp4if/2019/index.html).  You can find the original repo and data [here](https://github.com/marcogdepinto/PropagandaDetection/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#pipeline-for-2019-workshop-on-nlp4if-censorship-disinformation-and-propaganda).  You can also find the findings of this shared conference challenge summarized in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/D19-5024/), and [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/D19-5000/).

The goal of this project was to explore supervised methods of classification.  I chose to use TF-IDF Logistic Regression and SVM. add more!!
